the reason for using SO_REUSEADDR is for multicasting
and generally so multiple sockets can connect to the same ip and port
something about 0.0.0.0:80 acting as a wildcard
which allows any ip and port socket to connect
1. In the socket constructor use socket.SOCK_STREAM, socket.AF_INET specifies ipv4
2. Server sockets bind to a port and ip and listens for incoming connections, while the client socket sends data to a server
3. Using the .setsockopt and setting the level to socket being socket.SOL_SOCKET and option being socket.SO_REUSEADDR to true
4. On servers we get the ip and port of connecting clients.
5. recv() returns an empty byte str which we use to break out of connection.
